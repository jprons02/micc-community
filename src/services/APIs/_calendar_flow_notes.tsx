/*
Yes, you can send the authentication token (access token) from your frontend to a Lambda function and make the API requests to the Google Calendar API from the backend (Lambda function). This approach is more secure because it keeps the access token and sensitive API logic on the server-side, where you have more control over security and access.

Here's a high-level overview of how you can implement this:

Frontend (Client-side):

User logs in to your application and obtains the access token (JWT).
The frontend sends the access token to the backend (Lambda function) as part of an API request.
Backend (Lambda function):

The backend (Lambda function) receives the API request containing the access token.
The backend validates the access token to ensure its authenticity and integrity. You can use a library like jsonwebtoken on the backend to validate the JWT.
Once the access token is validated, the Lambda function can make authorized API requests to the Google Calendar API on behalf of the user.
To implement this, you need to set up an API endpoint on your Lambda function that accepts the access token in the request, validates it, and then makes the appropriate API requests to the Google Calendar API.
